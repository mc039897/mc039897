This year I hope to learn how to actually code. I've done things like Code Combat and Scratch, but I've never actually learned how to code and debug.

I belive computer science is importaint because everything in our modern world is about electronics, or computer science. You almost always have some sort of electronic device which was programed using computer science or something made by a robot, again programed using computer science.
